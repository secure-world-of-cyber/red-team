Some cheat sheet to upgrade a reverse shell into a stable and fully usable TTY shell. You need just to copy them and paste them on the target.

First, you need to verify if python is installed on the target system by running this command: which python python2 python3

Depending on the python version installed on the target system, you can now execute the below commands to get a fully usable or better TTY shell:

 python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
 export PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/local/games:/usr/games
 export TERM=xterm-256color # OR type just: export TERM=xterm
 stty raw -echo ; fg ; reset
 stty columns 200 raws 200 # OR type just: tput cols 200; tput lines 200
