This is a python script that allows a pentester to execute command remotly on a server. To use the script, you need just to change the value of the server_ip variable and put the IP address of the server that you want to connect to and execute command. After changes the IP address, you need to execute firstly the script on the remote server and type 2 and click enter button. Secondly, you need to execute the script your machine and type 1 and click the enter button to connect back to the remote server and start executing your preferred commands. Feel free to download it and use it. Thanks
